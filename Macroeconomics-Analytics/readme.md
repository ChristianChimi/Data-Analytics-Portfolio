Hi! This is a macroeconomics data analytics. I downloaded GDP, unemployment ratio and inflation csv data from Data World Bank.

Pre-analytics steps:
  - First cleaning: Drop useless columns, remove NaN, intersection between dataframe
  - Data conversion to more readable values.
  - Melting to transform dataframes from wide to long format.
  - Merge all dataframes to consolidate the data into a single and easy accessible dataframe

Eda:
  - Phillip's Curve and evaluation on canada and Italy
  - Economic Stress index intialization and visualization
  - Monte Carlo method tu predict GDP growth
  - Deep Learning: Random Forest Classificator on GDP datagrame to identify recession years
